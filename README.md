A personal fork, mostly for aesthetic reasons. (Functionally, PNC has everything already!)

- Extended notification colour to behind title, to look like native Pebble notifications
- Added scroll content indicators
- Added a heart 'jumboji'
- App glance shows most recent notification

Things that would be good:

- making my aesthetic changes a configuration option, so that it doesn't conflict/compete with other options
- making notification image not display in background: I like it, I want it, but scrolling 'up' to see it is weird and ugly.
- Perhaps 'active notifications' more useful in app glance
A great many thanks to matejdro for this amazing app!
